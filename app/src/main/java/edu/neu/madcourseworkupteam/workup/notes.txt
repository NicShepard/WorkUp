//Create a challenge

//Users navigate to dedicated "Challenge Friends" Page that will allow them to start new challenges
and also accept challenges from friends. The page has a search bar, a recycler view of usernames in a list,
a date picker for start date, and a date picker for end date
and a "Create Challenge" button

The user will use a search bar to search for users to challenge by username, if the username exists they can be
added and then appear in the list below the search bar.

When the user clicks Create Challenge, if at least one other user has been added, the following will happen:

All the selected users will be notified by cloud messaging using the device key stored in their user profile which we will populate everytime they log in
A new challenge record will be created with a unique key generated by firebase
A map of users with the key of their usernames and boolean of whether they've accepted,
a boolean flag of "active" which will default as false and set as true after
the first person accepts it.

When the user views the landing page it will make a call that will get all challenges, and then filter out for
challenges that are active. It will display these in the recycler view.

When the user views the "Challenge Friends" page it will make a call to get all challenges and then
filter out for pages that are active or "pending", meaning it hasn't reached the end of the challenge date
and no users have accepted. For now, a challenge cannot be cancelled.

Once this is done, we should make it so that a user cannot challenge someone they already have a challenge with.
